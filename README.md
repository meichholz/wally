## About GTK3

See [here](http://zetcode.com/gui/rubygtk/) for a tutorial.
Normally, the required Super-GEM **gtk3** should be installable, when the development libraries are there (as for Ruby 2.1, RVM and Gentoo).

Since GTK2 is obsolete, and we target Debian 8, there seems to be no point
in sticking to it.
